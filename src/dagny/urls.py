    Helper for connecting to resources from your URLconf.
    
    Basic Usage:
    
        from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
        from dagny.urls import resource
        
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^users/', resource('myapp.resources.User'))
        )
    
    Remember not to terminate the regex with a `$` character; `resource()`
    actually builds and `include()`s a sub-URLconf, and terminating the regex
    will prevent it from matching anything but the index.
    
    `resource()` supports 4 basic types of URI (shown here with the trailing
    slash, which is Djangoâ€™s default behavior):
    
        Path                Action
        ---------------------------
        /items/             index
        /items/new/         new
        /items/<id>/        show
        /items/<id>/edit/   edit
    
    In your resource definitions there are usually 7 standard actions, however,
    since routing in Django is independent of the request method, `resource()`
    only acknowledges these four. Note that if a request is received for an
    undefined action, your `Resource` will return the appropriate 404 or 405
    response, regardless of what is defined in your URLconf.
    
    You can restrict the generated patterns by passing the `actions` keyword
    argument to `resource()`:
    
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^items/', resource('myapp.resources.Item', actions=('index', 'show')))
        )
    
    The `<id>` parameter mentioned above can also be customized; by default it
    is just a regex pattern which looks for one or more digits (`r'\d+'`), but
    you could use slugs instead by passing an appropriate `id` keyword argument:
    
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^items/', resource('myapp.resources.Item', id=r'[\w\-_]+'))
        )
    
    This is where the `actions` parameter becomes useful; if you're using slugs,
    you might want to use a different `new` URI, otherwise you'd need to check
    that no object had a slug of `'new'`.
